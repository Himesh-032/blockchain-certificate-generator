# DOCUMENTATION:

# Blockchain Based Certificate

Problem:

    Currently large no of training programs is organized, and certificates are provided.
    There is no mechanism to validate digital certificate.

What are we going to do:
    
    We are going to create a website then can store verified certificate digitally using opensource blockchain.

What technology we are utilizing?

    •  We are going to utilize an opensource blockchain POLYGON.
    •  To validate that given digital certificate is original/authenticate or not, we will create NFTs of those certificate.
    •  We can validate the certificate by checking on chain transaction.
 
Process of creating certificate

    •  To create a certificate an organization/industry has to be verified first.
    •  They will check if the person has an existing account or not.
    •  If he/she already has an account they will send the certificate to the person.
    •  If not then they will create an account for the person by verifying the personal details.

Process of Verifying Certificate

    •  After creating the certificate from our website, organization will receive both Hash and Certificate.
    •  Organization will verify that the certificate is fake or real based on that hash that we've provided along Certificate.
    •  Hash is generated using blockchain so it is unique and irreplicable.

Why choose NFT?

    •  NFTs are immutable records so once a certificate is created and recorded on the blockchain as an NFT,
        it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of the certificate.
    •  Once NFT is linked to individual users, This can prevent certificate fraud and make it easy to verify
        the authenticity of the certificate
    •  NFTs also store ownership history, providing a clear trail if certificate ownership is altered over time.
